# Project Title: Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG) System for Research Papers

## Description
This project implements a Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using GPT-4 and Pinecone to assist researchers in quickly accessing up-to-date information on research papers. It dynamically combines the generative capabilities of GPT-4 with real-time data retrieval, ensuring responses are both current and relevant.

## Features
- **Real-time Data Retrieval**: Dynamically pulls information to provide the most up-to-date responses.
- **GPT-4 Integration**: Utilizes the advanced generative capabilities of GPT-4 for creating coherent and contextually relevant answers.
- **Pinecone Vector Storage**: Employs Pinecone for efficient and scalable vector storage to manage the retrieval process.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project environment and run the system locally.

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed on your machine. You can check your Python version by running:
```bash
python --version
Setting Up a Virtual Environment
To create a virtual environment and activate it, run the following commands:

bash
Copy code
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
venv\\Scripts\\activate
# On Unix or MacOS
source venv/bin/activate
Installing Dependencies
Install all required dependencies by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Describe how to run the scripts in your project. For example:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Scripts and Modules
main.py
Main script that initializes and runs the RAG system.

retriever.py
Handles the retrieval of documents based on query inputs.

generator.py
